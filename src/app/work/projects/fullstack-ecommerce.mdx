## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building a dynamic, component-based user interface.
- **Redux**: For centralized state management across the application.
- **Firebase**: For authentication, database, and hosting services.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For responsive and modern styling.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building an e-commerce platform required balancing multiple concerns: user experience, data consistency, security, and performance. Implementing real-time inventory updates while handling concurrent user actions was particularly challenging. This project strengthened my understanding of state management patterns and Firebase's real-time capabilities.

## Outcome

The platform demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development with modern React patterns, state management, and cloud services integration. It serves as a showcase of building production-ready web applications with attention to UX and scalability.
