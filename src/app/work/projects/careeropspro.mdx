## Overview

CareerOps Pro is an AI-powered platform designed to help job seekers prepare for their career journey. Built with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, it provides intelligent resume optimization and realistic interview practice sessions.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Resume Analysis**: Built a RAG-based application using Streamlit and LangChain to analyze and optimize resumes based on job descriptions.
- **Real-Time Interview Practice**: Integrated GPT-4o with speech-to-text and text-to-speech to support realistic, real-time interview sessions with structured feedback loops.
- **PDF Generation Pipeline**: Implemented PDF generation and text extraction pipelines, emphasizing predictable data flow, error handling, and maintainability.
- **Structured Feedback**: Provides detailed feedback on interview responses with actionable improvement suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python & Streamlit**: For rapid prototyping and interactive UI.
- **LangChain**: For building RAG workflows and LLM orchestration.
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: For natural language understanding and generation.
- **Speech APIs**: For speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
- **Vector Database**: For efficient document retrieval and semantic search.

## Challenges and Learnings

Building a seamless real-time interview experience required careful attention to latency optimization and error handling. Integrating multiple AI services (LLM, STT, TTS) while maintaining a smooth user experience was challenging but rewarding. The project deepened my understanding of RAG architectures and production-ready AI systems.

## Outcome

CareerOps Pro demonstrates practical applications of AI in career development, showcasing how LLM-based workflows can be integrated into production-style systems to provide real value to users.
