## Key Features

- **High Availability**: Deployed on AWS with EC2, ELB (Elastic Load Balancer), and Auto Scaling to ensure uptime during traffic spikes.
- **Content Management**: Robust content management system for educational articles and course materials.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented caching strategies and CDN integration for fast content delivery.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive monitoring setup for tracking performance and quickly identifying issues.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2**: For scalable compute instances.
- **AWS ELB**: For load balancing across multiple instances.
- **AWS Auto Scaling**: For automatic capacity adjustment based on traffic.
- **AWS S3**: For static asset storage and backup.
- **CloudWatch**: For monitoring and alerting.

## Challenges and Learnings

Managing a high-traffic platform required deep understanding of AWS services and infrastructure optimization. Handling unpredictable traffic spikes during course launches taught me the importance of proper auto-scaling configurations and load testing. This project significantly improved my DevOps and cloud infrastructure skills.

## Outcome

The blog successfully handles high traffic volumes with minimal downtime, serving thousands of users daily. The infrastructure setup demonstrates practical experience with AWS services and production-grade deployment practices.
